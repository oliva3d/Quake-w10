# Quake-w10
This is the original code compiled to be compatible with Windows 10. The main changes are:

Removed the old Glide2d library.
Updated the OpenGL library (32-bit) to fully support Windows 10.
The default resolution when starting the game is now Full HD.

# Important:

You need to add the original game's .PAK files inside the id1 folder. These files are protected by copyright (only the source code has been released). Without these files, the game will not run.
